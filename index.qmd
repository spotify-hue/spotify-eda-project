# Welcome

This site presents our **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of the **Spotify Top 200 Global Tracks (2017–2023)**.  
The project explores how musical features (danceability, energy, loudness, etc.) relate to song popularity.

## Project Overview

- **Goal:** Understand whether measurable audio features influence a song’s success.  
- **Dataset:** Top 200 Spotify global charts (2017–2023) with audio attributes from Kaggle.  
- **Methodology:**  
  - Data cleaning and preprocessing  
  - Exploratory visualizations using Plotly Express  
  - Correlation analysis between features and popularity metrics  
  - Nationality-based performance comparisons  
- **Tools:** Python 3, Pandas, Plotly Express, SciPy, Quarto.

## Results Summary

Popular tracks are generally **danceable**, **energetic**, and **loud**.  
However, no single feature strongly predicts success — indicating that **marketing and cultural context** likely play bigger roles.
